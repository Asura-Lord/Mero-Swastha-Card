About The Project
Mero Swastha Card addresses the challenge of fragmented, paper-based medical records in Nepal. By providing every citizen with a secure and portable digital health ID, we empower them to own their health history.
For healthcare providers, the platform offers a streamlined Clinic Portal to instantly access patient records, log visits, and manage follow-ups, ultimately leading to more efficient and informed patient care. This project aims to serve as a foundational piece of digital health infrastructure.
